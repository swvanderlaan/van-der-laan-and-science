The **Van der Laan Lab** has been a center for the research of atherosclerotic genetics, teaching, and practice since its founding in 2016. 

Our research is focused on the genetic causes of atherosclerosis underlying *ischemic stroke (IS)* and *coronary artery disease (CAD)*, and their intermediate traits such as *carotid intima media thickness (cIMT)* and *arterial calcification*. With our work we aim to move from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci to novel therapeutic targets and (surrogate) biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases through extensive *in silico*, and *in vitro* modelling.

As a means to this end, we currently employ the latest statistical genetics methods for fine-mapping, co-localisation, causal inference, molecular quantitative trait loci analyses, and GWAS. We develop methods for plaque characterisation based on high-throughput imaging of histological slides and machine learning algorithms. 

Our work has resulted in the identification over 28 loci with a substrate in plaques that harbour genes potentially causal to atherosclerosis and amenable to therapy. We are currently pursuing several targets *in vitro*.
