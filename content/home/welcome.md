The **Van der Laan Lab** has been a center for the research of atherosclerotic genetics, teaching, and practice since its founding in 2016. 

Our research is focused on the genetic and epigenetic causes of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis underlying *ischemic stroke (IS)* and *coronary artery disease (CAD)*, and their intermediate traits such as *carotid intima media thickness (cIMT)* and *arterial calcification*. With our work we aim to move from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci to novel therapeutic targets and (surrogate) biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases through extensive *in silico*, and *in vitro* modelling.

As a means to this end, we currently employ fine-mapping and co-localisation, causal inference, expression and methylation quantitative trait loci analyses, GWAS, (single-cell) RNA sequencing, and plaque characterisation based on high-throughput imaging of histological slides and machine learning algorithms. 

Our work has resulted in the identification over 28 loci with a substrate in plaques that harbour genes potentially causal to atherosclerosis and amenable to therapy. We are currently pursuing several targets *in vitro*.
