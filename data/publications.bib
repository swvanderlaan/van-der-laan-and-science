              genome-wide-association meta-analysis in 521,612 individuals
              (67,162 cases and 454,450 controls) and discovered 22 new stroke
              risk loci, bringing the total to 32. We further found shared
              genetic variation with related vascular traits, including blood
              pressure, cardiac traits, and venous thromboembolism, at
              individual loci (n = 18), and using genetic risk scores and
              linkage-disequilibrium-score regression. Several loci exhibited
              distinct association and pleiotropy patterns for etiological
              stroke subtypes. Eleven new susceptibility loci indicate
              mechanisms not previously implicated in stroke pathophysiology,

              through bioinformatics analyses using extensive functional

  abstract = "Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified
              697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained
              one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing
              different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show
              that the most strongly associated ∼2,000, ∼3,700 and ∼9,500 SNPs
              explained ∼21\%, ∼24\% and ∼29\% of phenotypic variance.
              Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60\% of
              heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were
              enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be
              involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not
              highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast
              growth factors, WNT/$\beta$-catenin and chondroitin
              sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways
              not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including
              mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results
              indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is
              characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent genome-wide association studies
              identified the histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene region as a
              major risk locus for large-vessel stroke and coronary artery
              disease. However, the mechanisms linking variants at this locus
              to vascular risk are poorly understood. In this study, we
              investigated the candidacy and directionality of HDAC9 in
              atherosclerosis and analyzed associations between risk alleles at
              7p21.1 and plaque characteristics. METHODS: Allele-dependent
              expression of HDAC9 was analyzed in human peripheral blood
              mononuclear cells of healthy donors. Effects of HDAC9 deficiency
              on atherosclerotic plaques were investigated in 18- and
              28-week-old ApoE(-/-) mice by histology and immunohistochemistry.
              We further performed detailed plaque phenotyping and genotyping
              of rs2107595, the lead single-nucleotide polymorphism for
              large-vessel stroke, in carotid endarterectomy samples of 1858
              subjects from the Athero-Express study. RESULTS: Gene expression
              studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed increased
              mRNA levels of HDAC9 but not of neighboring genes (TWIST1/FERD3L)
              in risk allele carriers of rs2107595. Compared with
              HDAC9(+/+)ApoE(-/-) mice, HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice exhibited
              markedly reduced lesion sizes throughout atherosclerotic aortas
              and significantly less advanced lesions. The proportion of
              Mac3-positive macrophages was higher in plaques from
              HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice, but this was largely because of a lower
              proportion of advanced lesions. Analysis of human atherosclerotic
              plaques revealed no association between rs2107595 and specific
              plaque characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that
              HDAC9 represents the disease-relevant gene at the stroke and
              coronary artery disease risk locus on 7p21.1, and that risk
              alleles in this region mediate their effects through increased
              HDAC9 expression. Targeted inhibition of HDAC9 might be a viable
              strategy to prevent atherosclerosis.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The eicosanoid genes ALOX5, ALOX5AP and LTA4H have
               been implicated in atherosclerosis. We assessed the impact of
               common variants in these genes on gene expression, circulating
               protein levels, and atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes. METHODS:
               We included patients from the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene
               Expression study (STAGE, N = 109), and the Athero-Express
               Biobank Study (AE, N = 1443). We tested 1453 single-nucleotide
               variants (SNVs) in ALOX5, ALOX5AP and LTA4H for association with
               gene expression in STAGE. We also tested these SNVs for
               association with seven histologically defined plaque phenotypes
               in the AE (which included calcification, collagen, cellular
               content, atheroma size, and intraplaque vessel density and
               hemorrhage). RESULTS: We replicate a known cis-eQTL (rs6538697,
               p = 1.96 $\times$ 10(-6)) for LTA4H expression in whole blood of
               patients from STAGE. We found no significant association for any
               of the SNVs tested with serum levels of ALOX5 or ALOX5AP (p >
               5.79 $\times$ 10(-4)). For atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes the
               strongest associations were found for intraplaque vessel density
               and smooth muscle cells in the ALOX5AP locus (p > 1.67 $\times$
               10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS: We replicate a known eQTL for LTA4H
               expression in whole blood using STAGE data. We found no
               associations of variants in and around ALOX5, ALOX5AP and LTA4H
               with serum ALOX5 or ALOX5AP levels, or plaque phenotypes. On the
               supposition that these genes play a causal role in
               atherosclerosis, these results suggest that common variants in
               these loci play a limited role (if any) in influencing advanced
               atherosclerotic plaque morphology to the extent that it impacts
               atherosclerotic disease.",

  abstract = "Homozygosity has long been associated with rare, often
              devastating, Mendelian disorders, and Darwin was one of the first
              to recognize that inbreeding reduces evolutionary fitness.
              However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness that
              is common in modern human populations is less well understood.
              Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of
              homozygosity on traits of public health importance by observing
              contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity), which are
              inferred to be homozygous along their complete length. Given the
              low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human
              populations, information is required on very large numbers of
              people to provide sufficient power. Here we use runs of
              homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits in
              354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically
              significant associations between summed runs of homozygosity and
              four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one
              second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment (P <
              1 $\times$ 10(-300), 2.1 $\times$ 10(-6), 2.5 $\times$ 10(-10)
              and 1.8 $\times$ 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased
              homozygosity was associated with decreased trait value,
              equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm shorter
              and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect sizes were
              found across four continental groups and populations with
              different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence
              that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly contributes
              to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports in
              substantially smaller samples, no evidence was seen of an
              influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low
              density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic
              traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits under
              directional evolutionary selection, this study provides evidence
              that increased stature and cognitive function have been
              positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important
              risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Although plasma lipid levels are known to
               influence the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), little is
               known about their effect on atherosclerotic plaque composition.
               To date, large-scale genome-wide association studies have
               identified 157 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
               that influence plasma lipid levels, providing a powerful tool to
               investigate the effect of plasma lipid levels on atherosclerotic
               plaque composition. METHODS: In this study, we included 1443
               carotid endarterectomy patients from the Athero-Express Biobank
               Study with genotype data. Plasma concentrations of high-density
               lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein
               cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides
               (TG) were determined at the time of endarterectomy.
               Atherosclerotic plaques, obtained during surgery, were
               histologically examined. For all patients, we calculated
               weighted genetic burden scores (GBS) for all lipid traits on the
               basis of the available genotype data. Plasma lipid levels and
               GBS were tested for association with 7 histological features
               using linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: All GBS
               were associated with their respective plasma lipid
               concentrations (pHDL-C = 2.4 $\times$ 10(-14), pLDL-C = 0.003,
               pTC = 2.1 $\times$ 10(-6), pTG = 3.4 $\times$ 10(-8)). Neither
               the measured plasma lipids, nor the GBS, were associated with
               histological features of atherosclerotic plaque composition. In
               addition, neither the plasma lipids nor the GBS were associated
               with clinical endpoints within 3 years of follow-up, with the
               notable exception of a negative association between HDL-C and
               composite cardiovascular endpoints. CONCLUSION: This study found
               no evidence that plasma lipid levels or their genetic
               determinants influence carotid plaque composition.",

               summary statistics were subsequently meta-analyzed in 17 941
               genes. We used the 'VErsatile Gene-based Association Study'
               (VEGAS) approach to assign variants to genes and to calculate
               gene-based P-values based on simulations. The VEGAS method was
               applied to each cohort separately before a gene-based
               meta-analysis was performed. In Stage 1, two known (FTO and
               TMEM18) and six novel (PEX2, MTFR2, SSFA2, IARS2, CEP295 and
               TXNDC12) loci were associated with BMI (P < 2.8 $\times$ 10(-6)
               for 17 941 gene tests). We confirmed all loci, and six of them
               were gene-wide significant in Stage 2 alone. We provide
               biological support for the loci by pathway, expression and
               methylation analyses. Our results indicate that gene-based
               meta-analysis of GWAS provides a useful strategy to find loci of
               interest that were not identified in standard single-marker
               analyses due to high allelic heterogeneity.",

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than
              100 genetic variants contributing to BMI, a measure of body size,
              or waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for BMI, WHRadjBMI), a measure of
              body shape. Body size and shape change as people grow older and
              these changes differ substantially between men and women. To
              systematically screen for age- and/or sex-specific effects of
              genetic variants on BMI and WHRadjBMI, we performed meta-analyses
              of 114 studies (up to 320,485 individuals of European descent)
              with genome-wide chip and/or Metabochip data by the Genetic
              Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium. Each
              study tested the association of up to ~2.8M SNPs with BMI and
              WHRadjBMI in four strata (men $\leq$50y, men >50y, women
              $\leq$50y, women >50y) and summary statistics were combined in
              stratum-specific meta-analyses. We then screened for variants
              that showed age-specific effects (G x AGE), sex-specific effects
              (G x SEX) or age-specific effects that differed between men and
              women (G x AGE x SEX). For BMI, we identified 15 loci (11
              previously established for main effects, four novel) that showed
              significant (FDR<5\%) age-specific effects, of which 11 had
              larger effects in younger (<50y) than in older adults
              ($\geq$50y). No sex-dependent effects were identified for BMI.
              For WHRadjBMI, we identified 44 loci (27 previously established
              for main effects, 17 novel) with sex-specific effects, of which
              28 showed larger effects in women than in men, five showed larger
              effects in men than in women, and 11 showed opposite effects
              between sexes. No age-dependent effects were identified for
              WHRadjBMI. This is the first genome-wide interaction
              meta-analysis to report convincing evidence of age-dependent
              genetic effects on BMI. In addition, we confirm the
              sex-specificity of genetic effects on WHRadjBMI. These results
              may provide further insights into the biology that underlies
              weight change with age or the sexually dimorphism of body shape.",

               identified six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to
               carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) or plaque. However,
               whether these loci relate to other vascular diseases and
               subsequent vascular events is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
               tested six SNPs (rs4888378, rs11781551, rs445925, rs6601530,
               rs17398575 and rs1878406) for association with subclinical
               atherosclerotic measures (cIMT, plaque presence and
               ankle-brachial index), as well as ischemic stroke, abdominal
               aortic aneurysm, peripheral or coronary artery disease (CAD) in
               the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) cohort.
               Four SNPs were associated with cIMT and two with plaque (p <
               0.05). One SNP was also significantly associated to CAD
               (rs1878406, OR = 1.24, 95\% CI = 1.08-1.42, p = 2 $\times$
               10(-3)). A genetic risk score (GRS) based on the cIMT-related
               SNPs was associated to increased risk of cIMT itself (p = 1
               $\times$ 10(-3)), but not to other secondary outcomes or
               vascular events during follow-up (p = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: In
               addition to replicating previously published associations for
               cIMT, we confirmed a nominally significant effect between the
               GRS and cIMT.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: So far, more than 170 loci have been associated with
              circulating lipid levels through genome-wide association studies
              (GWAS). These associations are largely driven by common variants,
              their function is often not known, and many are likely to be
              markers for the causal variants. In this study we aimed to
              identify more new rare and low-frequency functional variants
              associated with circulating lipid levels. METHODS: We used the
              1000 Genomes Project as a reference panel for the imputations of
              GWAS data from ∼60 000 individuals in the discovery stage and ∼90
              000 samples in the replication stage. RESULTS: Our study resulted
              in the identification of five new associations with circulating
              lipid levels at four loci. All four loci are within genes that
              can be linked biologically to lipid metabolism. One of the
              variants, rs116843064, is a damaging missense variant within the
              ANGPTL4 gene. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that GWAS with
              high-scale imputation may still help us unravel the biological
              mechanism behind circulating lipid levels.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The genetically modified mouse is the most commonly
              used animal model for studying the pathogenesis of
              atherosclerotic disease. We aimed to assess if mice
              atherosclerosis-related genes could be validated in human disease
              through examination of results from genome-wide association
              studies. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review
              to identify atherosclerosis-causing genes in mice and carried out
              gene-based association tests of their human orthologs for an
              association with human coronary artery disease and human large
              artery ischemic stroke. Moreover, we investigated the association
              of these genes with human atherosclerotic plaque characteristics.
              In addition, we assessed the presence of tissue-specific
              cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci for these genes in
              humans. Finally, using pathway analyses we show that the putative
              atherosclerosis-causing genes revealed few associations with
              human coronary artery disease, large artery ischemic stroke, or
              atherosclerotic plaque characteristics, despite the fact that the
              majority of these genes have cis-acting expression quantitative
              trait loci. CONCLUSIONS: A role for genes that has been observed
              in mice for atherosclerotic lesion development could scarcely be
              confirmed by studying associations of disease development with
              common human genetic variants. The value of murine
              atherosclerotic models for selection of therapeutic targets in
              human disease remains unclear.",

  abstract = "Very few genetic variants have been associated with depression
              and neuroticism, likely because of limitations on sample size in
              previous studies. Subjective well-being, a phenotype that is
              genetically correlated with both of these traits, has not yet
              been studied with genome-wide data. We conducted genome-wide
              association studies of three phenotypes: subjective well-being (n
              = 298,420), depressive symptoms (n = 161,460), and neuroticism (n
              = 170,911). We identify 3 variants associated with subjective
              well-being, 2 variants associated with depressive symptoms, and
              11 variants associated with neuroticism, including 2 inversion
              polymorphisms. The two loci associated with depressive symptoms
              replicate in an independent depression sample. Joint analyses
              that exploit the high genetic correlations between the phenotypes
              (|$\rho$^| $\approx$ 0.8) strengthen the overall credibility of
              the findings and allow us to identify additional variants. Across
              our phenotypes, loci regulating expression in central nervous

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies show that high circulating
              cystatin C is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease
              (CVD), independent of creatinine-based renal function
              measurements. It is unclear whether this relationship is causal,
              arises from residual confounding, and/or is a consequence of
              reverse causation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to use
              Mendelian randomization to investigate whether cystatin C is
              causally related to CVD in the general population. METHODS: We
              incorporated participant data from 16 prospective cohorts (n =
              76,481) with 37,126 measures of cystatin C and added genetic data
              from 43 studies (n = 252,216) with 63,292 CVD events. We used the
              common variant rs911119 in CST3 as an instrumental variable to
              investigate the causal role of cystatin C in CVD, including
              coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.
              RESULTS: Cystatin C concentrations were associated with CVD risk
              after adjusting for age, sex, and traditional risk factors
              (relative risk: 1.82 per doubling of cystatin C; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI]: 1.56 to 2.13; p = 2.12 $\times$ 10(-14)). The
              minor allele of rs911119 was associated with decreased serum
              cystatin C (6.13\% per allele; 95\% CI: 5.75 to 6.50; p = 5.95
              $\times$ 10(-211)), explaining 2.8\% of the observed variation in
              cystatin C. Mendelian randomization analysis did not provide
              evidence for a causal role of cystatin C, with a causal relative
              risk for CVD of 1.00 per doubling cystatin C (95\% CI: 0.82 to
              1.22; p = 0.994), which was statistically different from the
              observational estimate (p = 1.6 $\times$ 10(-5)). A causal effect
              of cystatin C was not detected for any individual component of
              CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization analyses did not
              support a causal role of cystatin C in the etiology of CVD. As
              such, therapeutics targeted at lowering circulating cystatin C
              are unlikely to be effective in preventing CVD.",

              and risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, very few genetic
              loci have been identified, and the underlying mechanisms of AFB
              and NEB are poorly understood. We report a large genome-wide
              association study of both sexes including 251,151 individuals for
              AFB and 343,072 individuals for NEB. We identified 12 independent
              loci that are significantly associated with AFB and/or NEB in a
              SNP-based genome-wide association study and 4 additional loci
              associated in a gene-based effort. These loci harbor genes that
              are likely to have a role, either directly or by affecting
              non-local gene expression, in human reproduction and infertility,
              thereby increasing understanding of these complex traits.",

              approximately 700 common associated variants identified through
              genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83
              height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele
              frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8\%) and effects of up to 2
              centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and
              CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common
              variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing
              alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2 centimetres per
              allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and
              increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher
              bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83
              height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in
              monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological
              candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such
              as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in

              lineage of the Y chromosome, is associated with increased risk of
              coronary artery disease in British men. It is unclear whether
              this haplogroup or any other haplogroup on the Y chromosome is
              associated with histological characteristics of the diseased
              vessel wall in other vascular manifestations of cardiovascular
              diseases showing a male preponderance. METHODS: We examined Dutch
              men undergoing either carotid endarterectomy from the
              Athero-Express biobank (AE, n = 1217) or open aneurysm repair
              from the Aneurysm-Express biobank (AAA, n = 393). Upon resolving
              the Y chromosome phylogeny, each man was assigned to one of the
              paternal lineages based on combinations of single nucleotide
              polymorphisms of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome. We
              examined the associations between the Y chromosome and the
              histological characteristics of the carotid plaque and aneurysm
              wall, including lipid content, leukocyte infiltration and
              intraplaque haemorrhage, in all men. RESULTS: A majority of men
              were carriers of either haplogroup I (AE: 28\% AAA: 24\%) or
              haplogroup R (AE: 59\% AAA: 61\%). We found no association
              between Y chromosomal haplogroups and histological
              characteristics of plaque collected from carotid arteries or
              tissue specimens of aneurysms. Moreover, the distribution of
              frequency for all Y chromosomal haplogroups in both cohorts was
              similar to that of a general population of Dutch men.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that genetic variation on the Y
              chromosome is not associated with histological characteristics of
              the plaques from carotid arteries or specimens of aneurysms in
              men of Dutch origin.",

              cases and 9,778 controls from Europe, Australia, and South Asia.
              We report on a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant in serpin
              family A member 1 (SERPINA1) encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin [AAT;
              p.V213A; P = 5.99E-9, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22] and confirm histone
              deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) as a major risk gene for LAS with an
              association in the 3'-UTR (rs2023938; P = 7.76E-7, OR = 1.28).
              Using quantitative microscale thermophoresis, we show that M1
              (A213) exhibits an almost twofold lower dissociation constant
              with its primary target human neutrophil elastase (NE) in
              lipoprotein-containing plasma, but not in lipid-free plasma.
              Hydrogen/deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry
              further revealed a significant difference in the global
              flexibility of the two variants. The observed stronger
              interaction with lipoproteins in plasma and reduced global
              flexibility of the Val-213 variant most likely improve its local
              availability and reduce the extent of proteolytic inactivation by
              other proteases in atherosclerotic plaques. Our results indicate
              that the interplay between AAT, NE, and lipoprotein particles is
              modulated by the gate region around position 213 in AAT, far away
              from the unaltered reactive center loop (357-360). Collectively,

               CARDIoGRAM and METASTROKE, are ongoing to reveal susceptibility
               loci for their underlying disease-atherosclerotic
               disease-identification of candidate genes explaining the
               associations of these loci has proven the main challenge. Many
               disease susceptibility loci colocalize with DNA regulatory
               elements, which influence gene expression through chromatin
               interactions. Therefore, the target genes of these regulatory
               elements can be considered candidate genes. Applying these
               biological principles, we used an alternative approach to
               annotate susceptibility loci and identify candidate genes for
               human atherosclerotic disease based on circular chromosome
               conformation capture followed by sequencing. METHODS AND
               RESULTS: In human monocytes and coronary endothelial cells, we
               generated 63 chromatin interaction data sets for 37 active DNA
               regulatory elements that colocalize with known susceptibility
               loci for coronary artery disease (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) and large
               artery stroke (METASTROKE). By circular chromosome conformation
               capture followed by sequencing, we identified a physical
               3-dimensional interaction with 326 candidate genes expressed in
               at least 1 of these cell types, of which 294 have not been

              contribution to obesity-related traits. Here, we use GWAS data
              from 51,080 current smokers and 190,178 nonsmokers (87\% European
              descent) to identify loci influencing BMI and central adiposity,

              adjusted for BMI. We identify 23 novel genetic loci, and 9 loci
              with convincing evidence of gene-smoking interaction (GxSMK) on
              obesity-related traits. We show consistent direction of effect
              for all identified loci and significance for 18 novel and for 5
              interaction loci in an independent study sample. These loci
              highlight novel biological functions, including response to
              oxidative stress, addictive behaviour, and regulatory functions
              emphasizing the importance of accounting for environment in
              genetic analyses. Our results suggest that tobacco smoking may

  abstract = "In the last decade, over 175 genetic loci have robustly been
              associated to levels of major circulating blood lipids. Most loci
              are specific to one or two lipids, whereas some (SUGP1, ZPR1,
              TRIB1, HERPUD1, and FADS1) are associated to all. While exposing
              the polygenic architecture of circulating lipids and the
              underpinnings of dyslipidaemia, these genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS) have provided further evidence of the critical
              role that lipids play in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, as
              indicated by the 2.7-fold enrichment for macrophage gene
              expression in atherosclerotic plaques and the association of 25
              loci (such as PCSK9, APOB, ABCG5-G8, KCNK5, LPL, HMGCR, NPC1L1,
              CETP, TRIB1, ABO, PMAIP1-MC4R, and LDLR) with CHD. These GWAS
              also confirmed known and commonly used therapeutic targets,
              including HMGCR (statins), PCSK9 (antibodies), and NPC1L1
              (ezetimibe). As we head into the post-GWAS era, we offer
              suggestions for how to move forward beyond genetic risk loci,
              towards refining the biology behind the associations and
              identifying causal genes and therapeutic targets. Deep
              phenotyping through lipidomics and metabolomics will refine and
              increase the resolution to find causal and druggable targets, and
              studies aimed at demonstrating gene transcriptional and
              regulatory effects of lipid associated loci will further aid in
              identifying these targets. Thus, we argue the need for deeply
              phenotyped, large genetic association studies to reduce costs and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for
               atherosclerotic disease and has been associated with DNA
               methylation (DNAm) changes in blood cells. However, whether
               smoking influences DNAm in the diseased vascular wall is unknown
               but may prove crucial in understanding the pathophysiology of
               atherosclerosis. In this study, we associated current tobacco
               smoking to epigenome-wide DNAm in atherosclerotic plaques from
               patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: DNAm at
               commonly methylated sites (cytosine-guanine nucleotide pairs
               separated by a phospho-group [CpGs]) was assessed in
               atherosclerotic plaque samples and peripheral blood samples from
               485 carotid endarterectomy patients. We tested the association
               of current tobacco smoking with DNAm corrected for age and sex.
               To control for bias and inflation because of cellular
               heterogeneity, we applied a Bayesian method to estimate an
               empirical null distribution as implemented by the R package
               bacon. Replication of the smoking-associated methylated CpGs in
               atherosclerotic plaques was executed in the second sample of 190
               carotid endarterectomy patients, and results were meta-analyzed
               using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Tobacco smoking was
               significantly associated to differential DNAm in atherosclerotic
               lesions of 4 CpGs (false discovery rate <0.05) mapped to 2
               different genes ( AHRR, ITPK1) and 17 CpGs mapped to 8 genes and
               RNAs in blood. The strongest associations were found for CpGs
               mapped to the gene AHRR, a repressor of the aryl hydrocarbon
               receptor transcription factor involved in xenobiotic
               detoxification. One of these methylated CpGs were found to be
               regulated by local genetic variation. CONCLUSIONS: The risk
               factor tobacco smoking associates with DNAm at multiple loci in
               carotid atherosclerotic lesions. These observations support
               further investigation of the relationship between risk factors
               and epigenetic regulation in atherosclerotic disease.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in
               part caused by lipid uptake in the vascular wall, but the exact
               underlying mechanisms leading to acute myocardial infarction and
               stroke remain poorly understood. Large consortia identified
               genetic susceptibility loci that associate with large artery
               ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease. However,
               deciphering their underlying mechanisms are challenging.
               Histological studies identified destabilizing characteristics in
               human atherosclerotic plaques that associate with clinical
               outcome. To what extent established susceptibility loci for
               large artery ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease relate
               to plaque characteristics is thus far unknown but may point to
               novel mechanisms. METHODS: We studied the associations of 61
               established cardiovascular risk loci with 7 histological plaque
               characteristics assessed in 1443 carotid plaque specimens from
               the Athero-Express Biobank Study. We also assessed if the
               genotyped cardiovascular risk loci impact the tissue-specific
               gene expression in 2 independent biobanks, Biobank of Karolinska
               Endarterectomy and Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression.
               RESULTS: A total of 21 established risk variants (out of 61)
               nominally associated to a plaque characteristic. One variant
               (rs12539895, risk allele A) at 7q22 associated to a reduction of
               intraplaque fat, P=5.09$\times$10-6 after correction for
               multiple testing. We further characterized this 7q22 Locus and
               show tissue-specific effects of rs12539895 on HBP1 expression in
               plaques and COG5 expression in whole blood and provide data from
               public resources showing an association with decreased LDL
               (low-density lipoprotein) and increase HDL (high-density
               lipoprotein) in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the
               view that cardiovascular susceptibility loci may exert their
               effect by influencing the atherosclerotic plaque

               association studies (GWAS) and examined associations of vascular
               risk factors and their genetic risk scores (GRS) with
               MRI-defined BI and a subset of BI, namely, small subcortical BI
               (SSBI), in 18 population-based cohorts (n = 20,949) from 5
               ethnicities (3,726 with BI, 2,021 with SSBI). Top loci were
               followed up in 7 population-based cohorts (n = 6,862; 1,483 with
               BI, 630 with SBBI), and we tested associations with related
               phenotypes including ischemic stroke and pathologically defined
               BI. RESULTS: The mean prevalence was 17.7\% for BI and 10.5\%
               for SSBI, steeply rising after age 65. Two loci showed
               genome-wide significant association with BI: FBN2, p = 1.77
               $\times$ 10-8; and LINC00539/ZDHHC20, p = 5.82 $\times$ 10-9.
               Both have been associated with blood pressure (BP)-related
               phenotypes, but did not replicate in the smaller follow-up
               sample or show associations with related phenotypes. Age- and
               sex-adjusted associations with BI and SSBI were observed for BP
               traits (p value for BI, p [BI] = 9.38 $\times$ 10-25; p [SSBI] =
               5.23 $\times$ 10-14 for hypertension), smoking (p [BI] = 4.4
               $\times$ 10-10; p [SSBI] = 1.2 $\times$ 10-4), diabetes (p [BI]
               = 1.7 $\times$ 10-8; p [SSBI] = 2.8 $\times$ 10-3), previous
               cardiovascular disease (p [BI] = 1.0 $\times$ 10-18; p [SSBI] =
               2.3 $\times$ 10-7), stroke (p [BI] = 3.9 $\times$ 10-69; p
               [SSBI] = 3.2 $\times$ 10-24), and MRI-defined white matter
               hyperintensity burden (p [BI] = 1.43 $\times$ 10-157; p [SSBI] =
               3.16 $\times$ 10-106), but not with body mass index or
               cholesterol. GRS of BP traits were associated with BI and SSBI
               (p $\leq$ 0.0022), without indication of directional pleiotropy.
               CONCLUSION: In this multiethnic GWAS meta-analysis, including
               over 20,000 population-based participants, we identified genetic
               risk loci for BI requiring validation once additional large
               datasets become available. High BP, including genetically
               determined, was the most significant modifiable, causal risk
               factor for BI.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 is a recognized
              risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, its effect
              on disease progression and subsequent events is unclear, raising
              questions about its value for stratification of residual risk.
              METHODS: A variant at chromosome 9p21 (rs1333049) was tested for
              association with subsequent events during follow-up in 103 357
              Europeans with established CHD at baseline from the GENIUS-CHD
              (Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease) Consortium
              (73.1\% male, mean age 62.9 years). The primary outcome,
              subsequent CHD death or myocardial infarction (CHD
              death/myocardial infarction), occurred in 13 040 of the 93 115
              participants with available outcome data. Effect estimates were
              compared with case/control risk obtained from the
              CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide
              Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary
              Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics) including 47 222 CHD cases and 122
              264 controls free of CHD. RESULTS: Meta-analyses revealed no
              significant association between chromosome 9p21 and the primary
              outcome of CHD death/myocardial infarction among those with
              established CHD at baseline (GENIUS-CHD odds ratio, 1.02; 95\%
              CI, 0.99-1.05). This contrasted with a strong association in
              CARDIoGRAMPlusC4D odds ratio 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.22; P for
              interaction <0.001 compared with the GENIUS-CHD estimate.
              Similarly, no clear associations were identified for additional
              subsequent outcomes, including all-cause death, although we found
              a modest positive association between chromosome 9p21 and
              subsequent revascularization (odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI,
              1.04-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to studies comparing
              individuals with CHD to disease-free controls, we found no clear
              association between genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 and risk
              of subsequent acute CHD events when all individuals had CHD at
              baseline. However, the association with subsequent
              revascularization may support the postulated mechanism of
              chromosome 9p21 for promoting atheroma development.",

               reproductive success, a phenomenon known as inbreeding
               depression. In humans, the importance of this effect has
               remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close
               relatives is both rare and frequently associated with
               confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding

               decrease [95\% CI 44-66\%] in the odds of having children.

               stroke (CES), large artery stroke (LAS), and small vessel stroke

               and CCS (Causative Classification System for Stroke), but
               agreement is only moderate. We have compared two approaches to
               combining the existing subtyping systems for a phenotype suited
               for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We used the NINDS
               Stroke Genetics Network dataset (SiGN, 11,477 cases with CCS and
               TOAST subtypes and 28,026 controls). We defined two new

               which an individual must be assigned a subtype by either CCS or

               stronger effects at known IS variants with the intersect

  abstract  = "RATIONALE: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of
               morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent genome-wide
               association studies revealed 163 loci associated with CAD.
               However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which the majority
               of these loci increase CAD risk are not known. Vascular smooth
               muscle cells (VSMCs) are critical in the development of CAD.
               They can play either beneficial or detrimental roles in lesion
               pathogenesis, depending on the nature of their phenotypic
               changes. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants associated with
               atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypes in VSMCs. METHODS AND
               RESULTS: We quantified 12 atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypes
               related to calcification, proliferation, and migration in VSMCs
               isolated from 151 multiethnic heart transplant donors. After
               genotyping and imputation, we performed association mapping
               using 6.3 million genetic variants. We demonstrated significant
               variations in calcification, proliferation, and migration. These
               phenotypes were not correlated with each other. We performed
               genome-wide association studies for 12 atherosclerosis-relevant
               phenotypes and identified 4 genome-wide significant loci
               associated with at least one VSMC phenotype. We overlapped the
               previously identified CAD loci with our data set and found
               nominally significant associations at 79 loci. One of them was
               the chromosome 1q41 locus, which harbors MIA3. The G allele of
               the lead risk single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs67180937
               was associated with lower VSMC MIA3 expression and lower
               proliferation. Lentivirus-mediated silencing of MIA3 (melanoma
               inhibitory activity protein 3) in VSMCs resulted in lower
               proliferation, consistent with human genetics findings.
               Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction of MIA3 protein
               in VSMCs in thin fibrous caps of late-stage atherosclerotic
               plaques compared to early fibroatheroma with thick and
               protective fibrous caps in mice and humans. CONCLUSIONS: Our
               data demonstrate that genetic variants have significant
               influences on VSMC function relevant to the development of
               atherosclerosis. Furthermore, high MIA3 expression may promote
               atheroprotective VSMC phenotypic transitions, including
               increased proliferation, which is essential in the formation or
               maintenance of a protective fibrous cap.",

               correlation between these polymorphisms and atherosclerosis in
               European populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: 803 patients referred
               to the Geneva University Hospitals for elective coronary
               angiography were divided according to the number of
               significantly stenosed vessels (from 0 to 3) and were genotyped

               association between histological carotid plaque composition of
               culprit lesions and Cx40 polymorphisms could be detected in 583
               Dutch patients of the Athero-Express study. CONCLUSIONS: Despite
               a clear antiatherogenic role of Cx40 in mice, our study could
               not detect an association of Cx40 promoter polymorphisms and CAD
               in human. Moreover, a correlation with atherosclerotic plaque

               artery and aneurysm related-symptoms in aortic and peripheral
               aneurysm patients. Aneurysm tissue of 415 patients included in
               the Aneurysm-Express biobank was used. A best-fit polygenic risk
               score (PRS) based on previous GWAS effect estimates was modeled
               for each clinical phenotype. The best-fit PRS (including 272

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Individuals with exceptional longevity and their
              offspring have significantly larger high-density lipoprotein
              concentrations (HDL-C) particle sizes due to the increased
              homozygosity for the I405V variant in the cholesteryl ester
              transfer protein (CETP) gene. In this study, we investigate the
              association of CETP and HDL-C further to identify novel,
              independent CETP variants associated with HDL-C in humans.
              METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of HDL-C within the CETP
              region using 59,432 individuals imputed with 1000 Genomes data.
              We performed replication in an independent sample of 47,866
              individuals and validation was done by Sanger sequencing.
              RESULTS: The meta-analysis of HDL-C within the CETP region
              identified five independent variants, including an exonic variant
              and a common intronic insertion. We replicated these 5 variants
              significantly in an independent sample of 47,866 individuals.
              Sanger sequencing of the insertion within a single family
              confirmed segregation of this variant. The strongest reported
              association between HDL-C and CETP variants, was rs3764261;
              however, after conditioning on the five novel variants we
              identified the support for rs3764261 was highly reduced
              ($\beta$unadjusted=3.179 mg/dl (P value=5.25$\times$10-509),
              $\beta$adjusted=0.859 mg/dl (P value=9.51$\times$10-25)), and
              this finding suggests that these five novel variants may partly
              explain the association of CETP with HDL-C. Indeed, three of the
              five novel variants (rs34065661, rs5817082, rs7499892) are
              independent of rs3764261. CONCLUSIONS: The causal variants in
              CETP that account for the association with HDL-C remain unknown.
              We used studies imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel for
              fine mapping of the CETP region. We identified and validated five
              variants within this region that may partly account for the
              association of the known variant (rs3764261), as well as other
              sources of genetic contribution to HDL-C.",

               initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and abdominal
               aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. However, associations of LTB4
               levels with tissue characteristics and adverse clinical outcome
               of advanced atherosclerosis and AAA are scarcely studied. We
               hypothesized that LTB4 levels are associated with a vulnerable
               plaque phenotype and adverse clinical outcome. Furthermore, that
               LTB4 levels are associated with inflammatory AAA and adverse
               clinical outcome. METHODS: Atherosclerotic plaques and AAA
               specimens were selected from two independent databases for LTB4
               measurements. Plaques were isolated during carotid
               endarterectomy from asymptomatic (n = 58) or symptomatic (n =
               317) patients, classified prior to surgery. LTB4 levels were
               measured without prior lipid extraction and levels were
               corrected for protein content. LTB4 levels were related to
               plaque phenotype, baseline patient characteristics and clinical
               outcome within three years following surgery. Seven non-diseased
               mammary artery specimens served as controls. AAA specimens were
               isolated during open repair, classified as elective (n = 189),
               symptomatic (n = 29) or ruptured (n = 23). LTB4 levels were
               measured similar to the plaque measurements and were related to
               tissue characteristics, baseline patient characteristics and
               clinical outcome. Twenty-six non-diseased aortic specimens
               served as controls. RESULTS: LTB4 levels corrected for protein
               content were not significantly associated with histological
               characteristics specific for vulnerable plaques or inflammatory
               AAA as well as clinical presentation. Moreover, it could not
               predict secondary manifestations independently investigated in
               both databases. However, LTB4 levels were significantly lower in
               controls compared to plaque (p = 0.025) or AAA (p = 0.017).
               CONCLUSIONS: LTB4 levels were not associated with a vulnerable
               plaque phenotype or inflammatory AAA or clinical presentation.
               This study does not provide supportive evidence for a role of
               LTB4 in atherosclerotic plaque destabilization or AAA expansion.
               However, these data should be interpreted with care, since LTB4

               cardiovascular diseases, we investigated temporal changes in the
               composition of atherosclerotic plaques removed from patients
               undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS AND RESULTS: The
               Athero-Express study is an ongoing, longitudinal, vascular
               biobank study that includes the collection of atherosclerotic
               plaques of patients undergoing primary carotid endarterectomy in
               the province of Utrecht from 2002 to 2011. Histopathologic
               features of plaques of 1583 patients were analyzed in intervals
               of 2 years. The analysis included quantification of collagen,
               calcifications, lipid cores, plaque thrombosis, macrophages,
               smooth muscle cells, and microvessels. Large atheroma, plaque
               thrombosis, macrophages, and calcifications were less frequently
               observed over time, with adjusted odds ratios of 0.72 (95\%
               confidence interval, 0.650-0.789), 0.62 (95\% confidence
               interval, 0.569-0.679), 0.87 (95\% confidence interval,
               0.800-0.940), and 0.75 (95\% confidence interval, 0.692-0.816)
               per 2-year increase in time, respectively. These changes in
               plaque characteristics were consistently observed in patient
               subgroups presenting with stroke, transient ischemic attack,
               ocular symptoms, and asymptomatic patients. Concomitantly, risk
               factor management and secondary prevention strategies among
               vascular patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy
               significantly improved over the past decade. CONCLUSIONS: In
               conclusion, over the past decade, atherosclerotic plaques
               harvested during carotid endarterectomy show a time-dependent
               change in plaque composition characterized by a decrease in
               features currently believed to be causal for plaque instability.

               plaque characteristics and outcome in men undergoing carotid
               endarterectomy. METHODS AND RESULTS: LOY was quantified in blood
               and plaque from raw intensity genotyping data in men within the

               culprit lesions used for histology and the measurement of
               inflammatory proteins. We tested LOY for association with
               (inflammatory) atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes and cytokines
               and assessed the association of LOY with secondary events during
               3-year follow-up. Of 366 patients with carotid endarterectomy,
               61 exhibited some degree of LOY in blood. LOY was also present
               in atherosclerotic plaque lesions (n=8/242, 3\%). LOY in blood
               was negatively associated with age ($\beta$=-0.03/10 y; r2=0.07;
               P=1.6$\times$10-7) but not with cardiovascular disease severity
               at baseline. LOY in blood was associated with a larger atheroma

               associated with secondary major cardiovascular events in a
               severely atherosclerotic population. Our data could indicate

              undergoing carotid endarterectomy have an increased risk for
              major atherosclerotic events in the presence of moderate or poor
              kidney function. Acceleration of vascular inflammatory responses
              is considered to be causally involved in progression of
              atherogenesis and poor outcome in chronic kidney disease
              patients. The association between kidney function and plaque
              composition has not been thoroughly investigated yet. The aim of
              this study was to investigate the association between kidney
              function and atherosclerotic plaque composition in patients
              undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: Atherosclerotic
              plaques, harvested from 1796 patients who underwent carotid
              endarterectomy, were immunohistochemically stained for
              macrophages, smooth muscle cells, calcifications, collagen,
              microvessels, lipid core size and intraplaque hemorrhage.
              Cytokines were measured in plaque and plasma and associated with
              kidney function. Quantitative proteomics were performed on 40
              carotid plaques and associated with kidney function. RESULTS:
              Decreased kidney function was associated with increased odds
              ratio of intraplaque hemorrhage, OR 1.15 (95\% CI; 1.02-1.29 (p =
              0.024)) and increased odds ratio of fibrous-atheromatous plaques
              (plaques with lipid core presenting more than 10\% of total
              plaque surface) OR 1.21 (95\% CI; 1.07-1.38 (p = 0.003)) per
              decrease of 20 points in eGFR. Proteomics revealed that decreased
              kidney function was associated with upregulation of the classical
              pathway of the complement system and the intrinsic pathway of the
              coagulation system. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased kidney function was

  abstract  = "Aims: The effects of testosterone on cardiovascular disease
               (CVD) as reported in literature have been ambiguous. Recently,
               the interplay between testosterone and oestradiol as assessed by
               testosterone/oestradiol (T/E2) ratio was suggested to be better
               informative on the normal physiological balance. Considering the
               role in CVD, we hypothesized that a low T/E2 ratio in men with
               CVD is associated with increased inflammation, a more unstable
               plaque and a worse cardiovascular outcome. Methods and results:
               Testosterone and oestradiol concentrations were determined in
               blood samples of 611 male carotid endarterectomy patients
               included in the Athero-Express Biobank Study. T/E2 ratio was
               associated with baseline characteristics, atherosclerotic plaque
               specimens, inflammatory biomarkers, and 3 year follow-up
               information. Patients with low T/E2 ratio had more unfavourable
               inflammatory profiles compared with patients with high T/E2 as
               observed by higher levels of C-reactive protein [2.81 $\mu$g/mL
               vs. 1.22 $\mu$g/mL (P < 0.001)] and higher leucocyte counts
               [8.98*109/L vs. 7.75*109/L (P = 0.001)] in blood. In
               atherosclerotic plaques, a negative association between T/E2
               ratio and number of neutrophils [B = -0.366 (P = 0.012)], plaque
               calcifications [OR: 0.816 (P = 0.044)], interleukin-6 (IL-6) [B
               = -0.15 (P = 0.009)], and IL-6 receptor [B = -0.13 (P = 0.024)]
               was found. Furthermore, in multivariate Cox regression analysis,
               low T/E2 ratio was independently associated with an increased
               risk for major cardiovascular events (MACE) during 3 year
               follow-up [hazard ratio 1.67 (95\% confidence interval
               1.02-2.76), P = 0.043]. In men with elevated body mass index
               (BMI), these effects were strongest. Conclusion: In male
               patients with manifest atherosclerotic disease, low T/E2 ratio
               was associated with increased systemic inflammation, increased
               inflammatory plaque proteins, and an increased risk of future
               MACE as compared to men with normal T/E2 ratio. These effects
               are strongest in men with elevated BMI and are expected to be
               affected by aromatase activity in white fat tissues.
               Normalization of T/E2 ratio may be considered as target for the
               secondary prevention of CVD in men.",

  abstract  = "AIMS: Mouse studies have established distinct monocyte subtypes
               that participate in the process of atherosclerotic lesion
               formation. The pro-inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocyte subtype
               actively contributes to murine plaque progression and
               destabilization. Also in humans, different peripheral monocyte
               subtypes have been identified, of which the CD14+CD16- classical
               monocyte is suggested to display similar pro-atherosclerotic
               properties as the murine Ly6Chigh subtype. We aimed to
               investigate if circulating CD14+CD16- classical monocytes
               associate with characteristics of a vulnerable carotid
               atherosclerotic plaque and if they associate with the risk of
               secondary adverse manifestations of atherosclerotic disease.
               METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 175 carotid endarterectomy
               patients of the Athero-Express biobank in our study. Just prior
               to surgical procedure, blood was collected and peripheral blood
               mononuclear cells were isolated. Characterization of monocyte
               subsets was performed by flow cytometry. Plaque characteristics
               were semi-quantitatively scored for the presence of fat,
               collagen, intraplaque hemorrhage and calcification. Vessel
               density, smooth muscle cells and macrophages were assessed
               quantitatively on a continuous scale. All features of a
               vulnerable plaque phenotype, including low amounts of collagen
               and smooth muscle cells, and increased fat content, vessel
               density, intraplaque hemorrhage and plaque macrophages were not
               significantly associated with differential levels of peripheral
               classical CD14+CD16- monocytes or other monocyte subsets. Using
               Cox regression models to evaluate the prognostic value of
               circulating monocyte subtypes, we found that total counts of
               peripheral monocytes, as well as CD14+CD16- classical and other
               monocyte subtypes were not associated with the risk of secondary
               cardiovascular events during 3 years follow-up. CONCLUSION:
               Circulating classical CD14+CD16- monocytes do not associate with
               specific vulnerable plaque characteristics. In addition, they do
               not predict secondary adverse manifestations. This suggests that
               in patients with established carotid artery disease, the
               circulating monocytes do not reflect plaque characteristics and
               have no value in identifying patients at risk for future

              (GENIUS-CHD) consortium was established to facilitate discovery
              and validation of genetic variants and biomarkers for risk of
              subsequent CHD events, in individuals with established CHD.
              METHODS: The consortium currently includes 57 studies from 18
              countries, recruiting 185 614 participants with either acute
              coronary syndrome, stable CHD, or a mixture of both at baseline.
              All studies collected biological samples and followed-up study
              participants prospectively for subsequent events. RESULTS:
              Enrollment into the individual studies took place between 1985 to
              present day with a duration of follow-up ranging from 9 months to
              15 years. Within each study, participants with CHD are
              predominantly of self-reported European descent (38\%-100\%),
              mostly male (44\%-91\%) with mean ages at recruitment ranging
              from 40 to 75 years. Initial feasibility analyses, using a
              federated analysis approach, yielded expected associations
              between age (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95\% CI, 1.14-1.16) per 5-year
              increase, male sex (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.21) and
              smoking (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.35-1.51) with risk of
              subsequent CHD death or myocardial infarction and differing
              associations with other individual and composite cardiovascular
              endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: GENIUS-CHD is a global collaboration
              seeking to elucidate genetic and nongenetic determinants of
              subsequent event risk in individuals with established CHD, to
              improve residual risk prediction and identify novel drug targets
              for secondary prevention. Initial analyses demonstrate the
              feasibility and reliability of a federated analysis approach. The
              consortium now plans to initiate and test novel hypotheses as
              well as supporting replication and validation analyses for other

              appear to underlie suicidal behavior. Alterations of RNA editing
              on the serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) pre-mRNA in the brain of
              suicides produce transcripts that attenuate 5-HT2CR signaling by
              impairing intracellular G-protein coupling and subsequent
              intracellular signal transduction. In brain, the distribution of
              RNA-editing enzymes catalyzing deamination (A-to-I modification)
              shows regional variation, including within the cerebral cortex.
              We tested the hypothesis that altered pre-mRNA 5-HT2CR receptor
              editing in suicide is region-specific. To this end, we
              investigated the complete 5-HT2CR mRNA-editing profile in two
              architectonically distinct cortical areas involved in mood
              regulation and decision-making in a clinically well-characterized
              cohort of age- and sex-matched non-psychiatric drug-free controls
              and depressed suicides. By using an original biochemical
              detection method, that is, capillary electrophoresis
              single-stranded conformational polymorphism (CE-SSCP), we
              corroborated the 5-HT2CR mRNA-editing profile previously
              described in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9
              (BA9)). Editing of 5-HT2CR mRNA displayed clear regional
              difference when comparing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9)
              and anterior cingulate cortex (BA24). Compared with
              non-psychiatric control individuals, alterations of editing
              levels of 5-HT2CR mRNA were detected in both cortical areas of
              depressed suicides. A marked increase in editing on 5-HT2CR was
              especially observed in the anterior cingulate cortex in suicides,
              implicating this cortical area in suicide risk. The results
              suggest that region-specific changes in RNA editing of 5-HT2CR
              mRNA and deficient receptor function likely contribute to the
              etiology of major depressive disorder or suicide.",

               in atherosclerosis, however the mechanism remains unclear. We
               investigated the impact of common genetic variants in OSM and
               its receptors, OSMR and LIFR, on overall plaque vulnerability,
               plaque phenotype, intraplaque OSMR and LIFR expression, coronary
               artery calcification burden and cardiovascular disease
               susceptibility. Methods and Results: We queried Genotype-Tissue
               Expression data and found that rs13168867 (C allele) was
               associated with decreased OSMR expression and that rs10491509 (A
               allele) was associated with increased LIFR expression in
               arterial tissues. No variant was significantly associated with
               OSM expression. We associated these two variants with plaque
               characteristics from 1,443 genotyped carotid endarterectomy
               patients in the Athero-Express Biobank Study. After correction
               for multiple testing, rs13168867 was significantly associated
               with an increased overall plaque vulnerability ($\beta$ = 0.118
               $\pm$ s.e. = 0.040, p = 3.00 $\times$ 10-3, C allele). Looking
               at individual plaque characteristics, rs13168867 showed
               strongest associations with intraplaque fat ($\beta$ = 0.248
               $\pm$ s.e. = 0.088, p = 4.66 $\times$ 10-3, C allele) and
               collagen content ($\beta$ = -0.259 $\pm$ s.e. = 0.095, p = 6.22
               $\times$ 10-3, C allele), but these associations were not
               significant after correction for multiple testing. rs13168867
               was not associated with intraplaque OSMR expression. Neither was
               intraplaque OSMR expression associated with plaque vulnerability
               and no known OSMR eQTLs were associated with coronary artery
               calcification burden, or cardiovascular disease susceptibility.
               No associations were found for rs10491509 in the LIFR locus.
               Conclusions: Our study suggests that rs1316887 in the OSMR locus
               is associated with increased plaque vulnerability, but not with
               coronary calcification or cardiovascular disease risk. It
               remains unclear through which precise biological mechanisms OSM
               signaling exerts its effects on plaque morphology. However, the
               OSM-OSMR/LIFR pathway is unlikely to be causally involved in
               lifetime cardiovascular disease susceptibility.",

  abstract  = "Treatment-emergent depression is a common complication in
               patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
               undergoing antiviral combination therapy with IFN-$\alpha$ and
               ribavirin. It has recently been shown that changes in A-to-I RNA
               editing rates are associated with various pathologies such as
               inflammatory disorders, depression and suicide. Interestingly,
               IFN-$\alpha$ induces gene expression of the RNA editing enzyme
               ADAR1-1 (ADAR1a-p150) and alters overall RNA editing activity.
               In this study, we took advantage of the high prevalence of
               pharmacologically induced depression in patients treated with
               IFN-$\alpha$ and ribavirin to test the interest of RNA
               editing-related biomarkers in white blood cells of patients. In
               this 16-week longitudinal study, a small cohort of patients was
               clinically evaluated using standard assessment methods prior to
               and during antiviral therapy and blood samples were collected to
               analyse RNA editing modifications. A-I RNA editing activity on
               the phosphodiesterase 8A (PDE8A) gene, a previously identified
               RNA editing hotspot in the context of lupus erythematosus, was
               quantified by using an ultra-deep next-generation sequencing
               approach. We also monitored gene expression levels of the ADAR
               enzymes and the PDE8A gene during treatment by qPCR. As
               expected, psychiatric evaluation could track treatment-emergent
               depression, which occurred in 30\% of HCV patients. We show that
               PDE8A RNA editing is increased in all patients following
               interferon treatment, but differently in 30\% of patients. This
               effect was mimicked in a cellular model using SHSY-5Y
               neuroblastoma cells. By combining the data of A-I RNA editing
               and gene expression, we generated an algorithm that allowed
               discrimination between the group of patients who developed a
               treatment-emergent depression and those who did not. The current
               model of drug-induced depression identified A-I RNA editing
               biomarkers as useful tools for the identification of individuals
               at risk of developing depression in an objective, quantifiable
               biological blood test.",

               eddy covariance technique, but these datasets are affected by
               gaps which hinder the estimation of robust long-term means and
               annual ecosystem exchanges. We compare results obtained using
               three gap-fill techniques: multiple regression (MR), multiple
               imputation (MI), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), applied
               to a one-year dataset of hourly CO(2) flux measurements
               collected in Lutjewad, over a flat agriculture area near the
               Wadden Sea dike in the north of the Netherlands. The dataset was
               separated in two subsets: a learning and a validation set. The
               performances of gap-filling techniques were analysed by
               calculating statistical criteria: coefficient of determination
               (R(2)), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error
               (MAE), maximum absolute error (MaxAE), and mean square bias
               (MSB). The gap-fill accuracy is seasonally dependent, with
               better results in cold seasons. The highest accuracy is obtained
               using ANN technique which is also less sensitive to
               environmental/seasonal conditions. We argue that filling gaps
               directly on measured CO(2) fluxes is more advantageous than the
               common method of filling gaps on calculated net ecosystem
               change, because ANN is an empirical method and smaller scatter
               is expected when gap filling is applied directly to
               measurements.",

               inflammatory disease presumably initiated by endothelial
               activation. Low vascular shear stress is known for its ability
               to activate endothelial cells. Differential DNA methylation
               (DNAm) is a relatively unexplored player in atherosclerotic
               disease development and endothelial dysfunction. Previous
               studies showed that the expression of 11 genes was associated
               with differential DNAm due to low shear stress in murine
               endothelial cells. We hypothesized a causal relationship between
               DNAm of shear stress associated genes in human carotid plaque
               and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Using
               Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis, we explored the potential
               causal role of DNAm of shear stress associated genes on
               cardiovascular disease risk. We used data from the
               Athero-Expression Biobank Study for the discovery of methylation
               quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in 442 advanced carotid plaques.
               Next, we performed MR analysis using these mQTLs and publicly
               available GWAS summary statistics of coronary artery disease
               (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS). RESULTS: We discovered 9 mQTLs
               in plaque in the promoters of shear stress associated genes. We
               found no significant effect of shear stress gene promoter
               methylation and increased risk of CAD and IS. CONCLUSIONS:
               Differential methylation of shear stress associated genes in
               advanced atherosclerotic plaques in unlikely to increase
               cardiovascular risk in human.",

  abstract  = "Increased blood lipid levels are heritable risk factors of
               cardiovascular disease with varied prevalence worldwide owing to
               different dietary patterns and medication use1. Despite advances
               in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing
               low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels2, heart disease
               remains the leading cause of death worldwide3.
               Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have
               led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as
               new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most
               previous GWAS4-23 have been conducted in European ancestry
               populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute
               to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include
               differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and
               linkage-disequilibrium patterns24. Here we conduct a
               multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of
               lipid levels in approximately 1.65 million individuals,
               including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the
               gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to
               support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries,
               even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing
               diversity rather than studying additional individuals of
               European ancestry results in substantial improvements in
               fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic
               prediction (evaluated in approximately 295,000 individuals from
               7 ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered
               loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS
               expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and
               fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for
               preventive and precision medicine25, we anticipate that
               increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate
               and equitable26 application of polygenic scores in clinical
               practice.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment
               is highly complex, and selective agents that modulate plaque
               stability are not yet available. We sought to develop a
               scRNA-seq analysis workflow to investigate this environment and
               uncover potential therapeutic approaches. We designed a
               user-friendly, reproducible workflow that will be applicable to
               other disease-specific scRNA-seq datasets. METHODS: Here we
               incorporated automated cell labeling, pseudotemporal ordering,
               ligand-receptor evaluation, and drug-gene interaction analysis
               into a ready-to-deploy workflow. We applied this pipeline to
               further investigate a previously published human coronary
               single-cell dataset by Wirka et al. Notably, we developed an
               interactive web application to enable further exploration and
               analysis of this and other cardiovascular single-cell datasets.
               RESULTS: We revealed distinct derivations of fibroblast-like
               cells from smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and showed the key
               changes in gene expression along their de-differentiation path.
               We highlighted several key ligand-receptor interactions within
               the atherosclerotic environment through functional expression
               profiling and revealed several avenues for future
               pharmacological development for precision medicine. Further, our
               interactive web application, PlaqView (www.plaqview.com), allows
               lay scientists to explore this and other datasets and compare
               scRNA-seq tools without prior coding knowledge. CONCLUSIONS:
               This publicly available workflow and application will allow for
               more systematic and user-friendly analysis of scRNA datasets in
               other disease and developmental systems. Our analysis pipeline
               provides many hypothesis-generating tools to unravel the
               etiology of coronary artery disease. We also highlight potential
               mechanisms for several drugs in the atherosclerotic cellular
               environment. Future releases of PlaqView will feature more
               scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq atherosclerosis-related datasets to
               provide a critical resource for the field, and to promote data

               plaque aggravation and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD).
               Transmembrane protein carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is
               hypoxia-induced and can be shed into the circulation as soluble
               CAIX (sCAIX). As plaque macrophages are hypoxic, we hypothesized
               a role for CAIX in macrophage function, and as biomarker of
               hypoxic plaque burden and CVD. As tumor patients with probable
               CVD are treated with CAIX inhibitors, this study will shed light
               on their safety profile. CAIX co-localized with macrophages
               (CD68) and hypoxia (pimonidazole), and correlated with lipid
               core size and pro-inflammatory iNOS+ macrophages in unstable
               human carotid artery plaques. Although elevated pH and reduced
               lactate levels in culture medium of CAIX knock-out (CAIXko)
               macrophages confirmed its role as pH-regulator, only spare
               respiratory capacity of CAIXko macrophages was reduced.
               Proliferation, apoptosis, lipid uptake and expression of pro-
               and anti-inflammatory genes were not altered. Plasma sCAIX
               levels and plaque-resident CAIX were below the detection
               threshold in 50 and 90\% of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases,
               respectively, while detectable levels did not associate with
               primary or secondary events, or intraplaque hemorrhage. Initial
               findings show that CAIX deficiency interferes with macrophage
               metabolism. Despite a correlation with inflammatory macrophages,
               plaque-resident and sCAIX expression levels are too low to serve
               as biomarkers of future CVD.",

               heterogeneity, yet the molecular complexity within the cells of
               human plaques has not been fully assessed. OBJECTIVE: Using
               single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility, we
               gained a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying
               human atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed
               single-cell RNA and single-cell ATAC sequencing on human carotid
               atherosclerotic plaques to define the cells at play and
               determine their transcriptomic and epigenomic characteristics.
               We identified 14 distinct cell populations including endothelial
               cells, smooth muscle cells, mast cells, B cells, myeloid cells,
               and T cells and identified multiple cellular activation states
               and suggested cellular interconversions. Within the endothelial
               cell population, we defined subsets with angiogenic capacity
               plus clear signs of endothelial to mesenchymal transition. CD4+
               and CD8+ T cells showed activation-based subclasses, each with a
               gradual decline from a cytotoxic to a more quiescent phenotype.
               Myeloid cells included 2 populations of proinflammatory
               macrophages showing IL (interleukin) 1B or TNF (tumor necrosis
               factor) expression as well as a foam cell-like population
               expressing TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells
               2) and displaying a fibrosis-promoting phenotype. ATACseq data
               identified specific transcription factors associated with the
               myeloid subpopulation and T cell cytokine profiles underlying
               mutual activation between both cell types. Finally,
               cardiovascular disease susceptibility genes identified using
               public genome-wide association studies data were particularly
               enriched in lesional macrophages, endothelial, and smooth muscle
               cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a transcriptome-based
               cellular landscape of human atherosclerotic plaques and
               highlights cellular plasticity and intercellular communication
               at the site of disease. This detailed definition of cell

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Studies examining the role of factor V Leiden among
               patients at higher risk of atherothrombotic events, such as
               those with established coronary heart disease (CHD), are
               lacking. Given that coagulation is involved in the thrombus
               formation stage on atherosclerotic plaque rupture, we
               hypothesized that factor V Leiden may be a stronger risk factor
               for atherothrombotic events in patients with established CHD.
               METHODS: We performed an individual-level meta-analysis
               including 25 prospective studies (18 cohorts, 3 case-cohorts, 4
               randomized trials) from the GENIUS-CHD (Genetics of Subsequent
               Coronary Heart Disease) consortium involving patients with
               established CHD at baseline. Participating studies genotyped
               factor V Leiden status and shared risk estimates for the
               outcomes of interest using a centrally developed statistical
               code with harmonized definitions across studies. Cox
               proportional hazards regression models were used to obtain age-
               and sex-adjusted estimates. The obtained estimates were pooled
               using fixed-effect meta-analysis. The primary outcome was
               composite of myocardial infarction and CHD death. Secondary
               outcomes included any stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary
               revascularization, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause
               mortality. RESULTS: The studies included 69 681 individuals of
               whom 3190 (4.6\%) were either heterozygous or homozygous (n=47)
               carriers of factor V Leiden. Median follow-up per study ranged
               from 1.0 to 10.6 years. A total of 20 studies with 61 147
               participants and 6849 events contributed to analyses of the
               primary outcome. Factor V Leiden was not associated with the
               combined outcome of myocardial infarction and CHD death (hazard
               ratio, 1.03 [95\% CI, 0.92-1.16]; I2=28\%;
               P-heterogeneity=0.12). Subgroup analysis according to baseline
               characteristics or strata of traditional cardiovascular risk
               factors did not show relevant differences. Similarly, risk
               estimates for the secondary outcomes including stroke, coronary
               revascularization, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause
               mortality were also close to identity. CONCLUSIONS: Factor V
               Leiden was not associated with increased risk of subsequent
               atherothrombotic events and mortality in high-risk participants
               with established and treated CHD. Routine assessment of factor V
               Leiden status is unlikely to improve atherothrombotic events
               risk stratification in this population.",

               disease (CVD) is a risk factor for CVD and a proxy for
               cardiovascular heritability. Polygenic risk scores (PRS)
               summarizing >1 million variants for coronary artery disease
               (CAD) are associated with incident and recurrent CAD events.
               However, little is known about the influence of FHx or PRS on
               secondary cardiovascular events (sCVE) in patients undergoing
               carotid endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS: We included 1788 CEA
               patients from the Athero-Express Biobank. A weighted PRS for CAD
               including 1.7 million variants was calculated (MetaGRS). The
               composite endpoint of sCVE during three years of follow-up
               included coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral events and
               cardiovascular death. We assessed the impact of FHx and MetaGRS
               on sCVE and carotid plaque composition. RESULTS: Positive FHx
               was associated with a higher 3-year risk of sCVE independent of
               cardiovascular risk factors and MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.40,
               95\%CI 1.07-1.82, p = 0.013). Patients in the highest MetaGRS
               quintile had a higher 3-year risk of sCVE compared to the rest
               of the cohort independent of cardiovascular risk factors
               including FHx (adjusted HR 1.35, 95\%CI 1.01-1.79, p = 0.043),
               and their atherosclerotic plaques contained more fat (adjusted
               OR 1.59, 95\%CI, 1.11-2.29, p = 0.013) and more macrophages (OR
               1.49, 95\%CI 1.12-1.99, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In CEA
               patients, both positive FHx and higher MetaGRS were
               independently associated with increased risk of sCVE. Moreover,
               higher MetaGRS was associated with vulnerable plaque

  abstract  = "RATIONALE: PCSKs (Proprotein convertase subtilisins/kexins) are
               a protease family with unknown functions in vasculature.
               Previously, we demonstrated PCSK6 upregulation in human
               atherosclerotic plaques associated with smooth muscle cells
               (SMCs), inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and
               mitogens. OBJECTIVE: Here, we applied a systems biology approach
               to gain deeper insights into the PCSK6 role in normal and
               diseased vessel wall. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analyses
               revealed association of intronic PCSK6 variant rs1531817 with
               maximum internal carotid intima-media thickness progression in
               high-cardiovascular risk subjects. This variant was linked with
               PCSK6 mRNA expression in healthy aortas and plaques but also
               with overall plaque SMA+ cell content and pericyte fraction.
               Increased PCSK6 expression was found in several independent
               human cohorts comparing atherosclerotic lesions versus healthy
               arteries, using transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. By
               immunohistochemistry, PCSK6 was localized to fibrous cap SMA+
               cells and neovessels in plaques. In human, rat, and mouse
               intimal hyperplasia, PCSK6 was expressed by proliferating SMA+
               cells and upregulated after 5 days in rat carotid balloon injury
               model, with positive correlation to PDGFB (platelet-derived
               growth factor subunit B) and MMP (matrix metalloprotease)
               2/MMP14. Here, PCSK6 was shown to colocalize and cointeract with
               MMP2/MMP14 by in situ proximity ligation assay. Microarrays of
               carotid arteries from Pcsk6-/- versus control mice revealed
               suppression of contractile SMC markers, extracellular matrix
               remodeling enzymes, and cytokines/receptors. Pcsk6-/- mice
               showed reduced intimal hyperplasia response upon carotid
               ligation in vivo, accompanied by decreased MMP14 activation and
               impaired SMC outgrowth from aortic rings ex vivo. PCSK6
               silencing in human SMCs in vitro leads to downregulation of
               contractile markers and increase in MMP2 expression. Conversely,
               PCSK6 overexpression increased PDGFBB (platelet-derived growth
               factor BB)-induced cell proliferation and particularly
               migration. CONCLUSIONS: PCSK6 is a novel protease that induces
               SMC migration in response to PDGFB, mechanistically via
               modulation of contractile markers and MMP14 activation. This
               study establishes PCSK6 as a key regulator of SMC function in
               vascular remodeling. Visual Overview: An online visual overview

               transcriptome on cardiovascular risk in women with former
               preeclampsia. METHODS: Platelets were isolated from asymptomatic
               women with previous preeclampsia, who underwent screening with
               coronary computed tomography angiography. Platelet RNA was
               isolated and used to construct gene networks using an unbiased
               approach. Platelet gene modules assembled from the network were
               related to risk factors and clinical traits of these women,
               including coronary artery calcium scores (CACS). RESULTS: We
               found multiple gene modules which correlated with CACS
               (correlation coefficients: 0.44 to 0.59, p = 0.05 to 0.007). The
               genes from two clinically relevant modules were expressed at a
               higher level in the group with calcifications (p = 3.9 $\times$
               10-10 and 0.02) and enriched for platelet-related gene-sets such
               as platelet activation. The first of these modules was also
               enriched (ppermutation = 0.0546) for genes mapped to known
               coronary artery disease susceptibility loci. Additional unbiased
               network analyses in platelet RNA of patients with overt

               $\times$ 10-9 to 1.7 $\times$ 10-47). CONCLUSIONS: We found
               platelet RNA modules that correlated with CACS in asymptomatic
               women with previous preeclampsia. Whether or not platelets
               directly contribute to this disease trajectory, or reflect the
               underlying plaque substrate remains to be determined, but

               for carotid plaque traits. We identify eight novel
               susceptibility loci for cIMT, one independent association at the
               previously-identified PINX1 locus, and one novel locus for
               carotid plaque. Colocalization analysis with nearby vascular
               expression quantitative loci (cis-eQTLs) derived from arterial
               wall and metabolic tissues obtained from patients with CHD
               identifies candidate genes at two potentially additional loci,
               ADAMTS9 and LOXL4. LD score regression reveals significant
               genetic correlations between cIMT and plaque traits, and both
               cIMT and plaque with CHD, any stroke subtype and ischemic
               stroke. Our study provides insights into genes and
               tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms linking atherosclerosis
               both to its functional genomic origins and its clinical
               consequences in humans.",

              employs predicted gene functions to systematically prioritize the
              most likely causal genes at associated loci, highlight enriched
              pathways and identify tissues/cell types where genes from
              associated loci are highly expressed. DEPICT is not limited to
              genes with established functions and prioritizes relevant gene
              sets for many phenotypes.",
